This is a beast! Look at the numbers! Look at the screenshots,
look at the people around just going nuts when they see this
display of unexplainable wealth. 

This little demon rob took two weeks to reach the top. Now the
account is famous for its monstrous results, 3 enigmas in FF,
level 190, 667k bp in a nightly basis, and now, right now, when
things couldn't be going better, this robot beast is going to 
hibernate. 

He was so harmful to the opponents and couldn't 
manage to not be as harmful to its creator. He took his sanity,
his time, his life was going downhill while he couldn't stop
thinking about his beloved creature. And when he felt that 
little drop of freedom after two days in which he wasn't 
allowed to keep taking care of his baby, he realized how much of
himself he'd given to this beautiful monster generated from his
very own hands. 

And now is farewell, for how long? I don't know.
The long night has just begun for him...
But one day, if this robot arise again from his long sleep,
the city will burn in chaos! But for now let's just sleep & rest
cause the night is dark, and full of terrors!
